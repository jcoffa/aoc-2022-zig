# Advent of Code 2022 - Learning Zig

This is my first time working through the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)
and I'm starting with the most recent problem set at the time of writing; the
[2022 event](https://adventofcode.com/2022). I'm using this primarily as a way
to learn the [Zig programming language](https://ziglang.org/). Key word here
being **learn**; do not go into this repository expecting the most elegant and
performant zig code you've ever seen!
